## Hi there! Welcome to my Github 👋

I'm Brooke, an aspiring environmental data scientist working to expand my technical skills in R and Python. ✨

🌱 I earned a Master's of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) degree at the Bren School for Environmental Science & Management. I am originally from San Diego, California. My hobbies outside of coding include going for runs, hiking, and spending time outdoors with friends and animals.
