## Hi there! My name is Brooke. ðŸ‘‹

I am an aspiring environmental data scientist hoping to expand my technical skills in R and Python. âœ¨

ðŸŒ± I am a Master's of Environmental Data Science grad student at the Bren School for Environmental Science & Management. I am originally from San Diego, California. My hobbies outside of coding include going for runs, hiking, and spending time with friends.
